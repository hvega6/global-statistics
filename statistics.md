# Which Statistic?

When analyzing data, choosing the right statistic is crucial for understanding the underlying patterns and behaviors. Below are some common statistics and their implications:

## 1. Rolling Sum
- **Definition**: The rolling sum calculates the sum of a specified number of previous data points in a time series.
- **Use Case**: Useful for understanding trends over time, especially in financial data or cumulative metrics.
- **Example**: If you have daily sales data, a rolling sum can show the total sales over the last week.

## 2. Global Mean
- **Definition**: The global mean is the average of all data points in a dataset.
- **Use Case**: Provides a general overview of the data, useful for comparing different datasets or understanding overall performance.
- **Example**: The average temperature over a year can give insights into climate trends.

## 3. Global Max
- **Definition**: The global max is the highest value in a dataset.
- **Use Case**: Identifies peak values, which can be critical for performance metrics or extreme events.
- **Example**: The highest stock price in a year can indicate market peaks.

## 4. Rolling Standard Deviation
- **Definition**: The rolling standard deviation measures the variability of a dataset over a specified number of previous data points.
- **Use Case**: Useful for assessing risk and volatility in time series data, particularly in finance.
- **Example**: A rolling standard deviation of stock prices can help identify periods of high volatility.

## Conclusion
Choosing the right statistic depends on the specific analysis goals. For example, if you want to understand trends over time, a **rolling sum** or **rolling standard deviation** might be more appropriate. If you're looking for overall performance, the **global mean** or **global max** could be more relevant.
